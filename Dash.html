    <h1>What is Dash?</h1>
    <p>Dash is a digital cryptocurrency like the famously known bitcoin. Unlike bitcoin however, it has some very distinct innovations that seperate it from it's predecessor and many other cryptocurrencies is it's internal organization.</p>
    <p> Dash has a unique voting system that allows individuals or organizations to create what is refered to as a "Master Node" by holding a thousand units of the currency as collateral. This is unique in the world of cryptocurrency as it gives users of the currency a voice on what gets funded as well as providing a way for proposals for future features, advertising and governance of the organization to be ratified by Master Node account holders. A side benefit of this system is that the developers of the currency are now bankrolled by the currency it's self allowing the developers to work directly to the users benefit, instead of being possibly co-opted by corporate interests. </p>
